Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q1: Why do I need an API key for Google Knowledge Graph?
A: The Google Knowledge Graph API requires an API key to fetch structured data about entities. Without it, the plugin will skip this data source.

Q2: Can I use this plugin without Peepso?
A: Yes! The plugin works independently of Peepso. If Peepso is not installed, it will display WordPress usernames instead.

Q3: How does caching work?
A: The plugin caches API responses for 24 hours using WordPress transients. This reduces the number of API calls and improves performance.

Q4: What happens if an API fails?
A: If an API fails to return results, the plugin will fall back to other data sources or display a "No results found" message.
